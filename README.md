# Dynamic Programming

Make your algorithm more efficient by storing some of the intermediate results.

Works very well when your algorithm has a lot of repetitive computations.


## Solving Problems

There are typically 3 ways to solve a problem using Dynamic Programming:

1. Recursion <br>
   If you notice there are a lot of repeated computations, implement 2.

2. Recursion + Store (Memoize) <br>
   If the recursion creates a call stack so massive that the stack overflows, implement 3.

3. Bottom-up <br>
